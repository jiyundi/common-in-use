**Motivation:** I saved all of the codes that I ever used frequently for some time but later forgot. Once I needed to remind myself of these, I always wasted my time in googling and viewing online pages.

Please note the codes in this repository are usually from others' work or in the public domain. Use caution if you'd like to refer to these.

To redo fitting for one spectrum, e.g., ``spec1d.m46.030.A2552.fits``, (and with your desired redshift, for example, z=0.68 and 0.67), use
